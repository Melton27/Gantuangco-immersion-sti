                                    Immersion Reflection Essay

   With this activity I joined for the first time, I fully understand why it was called an immersion. 
It was to put or absorb ourselves into the situation of others. This 80 hours of experience is 
helpful and meaningful experience. It's always been a pleasure gaining more knowledge, ideas, and background in choosing what course am I going to pursue in College. This experience helps on how to become a better person.

   I was having a hard time not owning a laptop and I had to borrow from 3 people just to continue what i started 
and it's a very big disadvantage for me because I cannot further study what I want to learn because I really lack the utilities. Even though I felt dissapointed at my first assessment I was still able to get the idea of the task and for me it's still a gain. Either way I am very grateful that I was able to grab this unforgettable opportunity, this experience is my stepping stone for my future.

   Lastly I want to thank you Sir Jay for teaching me all the things that I never ever thought of learning.
Thank you again I am forever grateful.
